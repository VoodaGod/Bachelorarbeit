Technical:

	0.	(get scene sync working)
	1.	Get body pose sync working, by hard setting pose of joints (no physics)
	2.	VR:
	2.1		Tracking of head, hands, feet
	2.2		Evaluate discrepancy feedback mechanisms in Jonathan's BA
	2.3		Implement most promising ones, maybe come up with new ones, especially for feet
	3.	User study:
	3.1		Build test rooms to evaluate different feedback mechanisms, focusing on feet
			such as: 
	3.1.1	Move a ball through a parcour (slalom etc.)
	3.1.2	Kick a ball (at a goal, or try to "dantel")
	3.1.3	Control something with pedals (automatic door, trash can...) 
	3.2		Questionnaire
