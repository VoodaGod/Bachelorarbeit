Virtual reality allows the user to be in and interact with an environment which generally does not match the actual environment the user is in. If the virtual body is simulated to only have phisically possible poses in the virtual world, this can lead to discrepancies between the virtual and real body of the user, when, for example, the user reaches through a virtual wall. These discrepancies negatively impact the feeling of embodiment of the user, so mechanisms to make users aware of these discrepancies, and thus allowing them to mitigate them, based on previous work on Virtual Embodiment by Jonathan Haudenschild will be evaluated, expanded on to include feet, and implemented into the Unity3D VR-Client for the Neurorobotics Platform.
